# Invisible Art Gallery - Documentation

## Project Status: Completed ✅

The Invisible Art Gallery is now a fully implemented platform where artists can upload "invisible" creations that reveal themselves only under specific conditions. This documentation provides an overview of the implemented features, architecture, and guides for installation and development.

## Concept
The platform enables artists to create anticipation and exclusivity around their work. Artwork is encrypted and stored securely, with various unveiling mechanisms:
- Time-based reveals (e.g., "Reveal on December 31, 2025")
- View-count triggers (e.g., "Reveal after 100 views")
- Location-based access (optional)
- Interactive conditions (e.g., "Reveal after 50 comments")

## Core Features
- ✅ Secure artwork upload and encryption system
- ✅ Customizable revelation conditions
- ✅ Real-time updates via WebSockets when conditions are met
- ✅ User profiles for artists and viewers
- ✅ Gallery browsing experience with placeholder visuals
- ✅ Artist dashboard for managing artworks
- ✅ Interactive comments section for each artwork
- ✅ Legal compliance with comprehensive Terms of Service
- ✅ Privacy Policy with detailed data handling information
- ✅ Modern, responsive user interface
- ✅ Optional AR integration for physical space reveals
